## Lessons Learned (Cumulative)

### Technical

1. **DataFrame handling:** Always use `.empty`, never truthiness
2. **ML model integration:** Load once in `__init__`, cache predictions
3. **Error handling:** Graceful fallbacks > crashes
4. **Logging:** Critical for debugging multi-agent systems
5. **GPU training:** 5-10x speedup worth the setup

### Architecture

1. **Modularity:** Separate concerns (data, models, agents, analysis)
2. **Configuration:** Centralize settings (config/settings.py)
3. **Tool pattern:** LangChain tools must return strings
4. **Backward compatibility:** Keep traditional methods alongside ML

### Process

1. **Incremental development:** Small stages easier to debug
2. **Documentation:** Write as you build, not after
3. **Testing:** Test each component independently before integration
4. **Version control:** Commit frequently with clear messages
