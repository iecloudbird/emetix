## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Data Coverage

#### yfinance Quarterly Financials

```python
# Test Result: AAPL
‚úó Quarters: 5 (insufficient for LSTM)
‚úó Date Range: 2024-Q3 to 2025-Q2 (~1 year)
‚úó Training Sequences: Cannot create 20-quarter sequences
```

#### Alpha Vantage Quarterly Financials

```python
# Test Result: AAPL
‚úì Quarters: 81 (excellent for LSTM)
‚úì Date Range: 2005-Q2 to 2025-Q2 (~20 years)
‚úì Training Sequences: Can create 61 sequences (81 - 20 = 61)
```

**Impact:** LSTM requires minimum 20 quarters lookback. Alpha Vantage provides **16x more data**!

### 2. Available Fields

#### Income Statement

| Field                   | yfinance | Alpha Vantage              |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| Total Revenue           | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ (totalRevenue)          |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ (operatingIncome, ebit) |
| Income Tax Expense      | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ (incomeTaxExpense)      |
| Income Before Tax       | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ (incomeBeforeTax)       |
| Net Income              | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ (netIncome)             |
| EBITDA                  | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ (ebitda)                |

| Free Cash Flow       | ‚úÖ       | ‚ö†Ô∏è Calculate (OCF - CapEx)                |

#### Balance Sheet

| Field        | yfinance | Alpha Vantage               |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Total Assets | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ (totalAssets)            |
| Total Equity | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ (totalShareholderEquity) |
| Total Debt   | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ (shortLongTermDebtTotal) |

**Result:** Both have all required fields. Alpha Vantage even more comprehensive (38 balance sheet fields vs yfinance's limited set).

### 3. Data Quality Test Results

#### Sample NOPAT Calculation (AAPL Q2 2025)

**Alpha Vantage:**

```
EBIT: $28.20B
Tax Rate: 16.40%
NOPAT = $28.20B √ó (1 - 0.164) = $23.58B ‚úì
```

**yfinance:**

```
EBIT: $28.20B
Tax Rate: ~16% (from quarterly_financials)
NOPAT = Similar calculation ‚úì
```

**Both accurate** - Alpha Vantage provides cleaner API structure.

---

### 4. Rate Limits & Practical Constraints

#### Alpha Vantage (FREE Tier)

```
Max Calls per Day: 25
Max Calls per Minute: 5
Calls per Stock: 3 (Income, Cash Flow, Balance Sheet)

For 500 stocks:
- Total calls needed: 500 √ó 3 = 1,500
- Days needed: 1,500 √∑ 25 = 60 days
- Stocks per day: 8-10 stocks

Strategy:
- Day 1: Fetch 8 stocks (24 API calls)
- Day 2: Fetch 8 stocks (24 API calls)
- ...
- Day 60: Complete 500 stocks
```

#### yfinance

```
Rate Limits: Soft limits (no hard cap)
Data Available: Only 5 quarters (INSUFFICIENT)

Problem:
- Cannot train LSTM with 5 quarters
- Need minimum 20 quarters for sequences
- Alpha Vantage is ONLY viable option
```

---

### 5. Training Data Preparation

#### What We Get from Alpha Vantage

**Raw Data per Stock:**

```python
# 81 quarters √ó 4 metrics = 324 data points per stock
{
    'date': ['2005-Q2', '2005-Q3', ..., '2025-Q2'],
    'revenue': [3.52B, 3.68B, ..., 94.04B],
    'capex': [63M, 96M, ..., 3.46B],
    'da': [46M, 51M, ..., 2.83B],
    'nopat': [288M, 376M, ..., 23.58B]
}
```

**Normalized by Assets (per article):**

```python
# Accounts for company scale
revenue_norm = revenue / total_assets
capex_norm = capex / total_assets
da_norm = da / total_assets
nopat_norm = nopat / total_assets
```

**Standardized for LSTM (mean=0, std=1):**

```python
revenue_std = (revenue_norm - mean) / std
# Output: [-2.5, 1.3, 0.8, ..., -0.5]  # Ready for neural network
```

**Training Sequences:**

```python
# For each stock with 81 quarters:
# Sequence length = 20 quarters
# Sequences created = 81 - 20 = 61 sequences

# Example sequence:
X = [
    [rev_std[0], capex_std[0], da_std[0], nopat_std[0]],  # Q1
    [rev_std[1], capex_std[1], da_std[1], nopat_std[1]],  # Q2
    ...
    [rev_std[19], capex_std[19], da_std[19], nopat_std[19]]  # Q20
]

# Target (growth rates for Q21):
y = [
    revenue_growth[21],
    capex_growth[21],
    da_growth[21],
    nopat_growth[21]
]
```

**Total Training Data (500 stocks):**

```
500 stocks √ó 61 sequences = 30,500 training examples
Each sequence: 20 quarters √ó 4 metrics = 80 features
Output: 4 growth rates

Dataset Size:
- Training: 24,400 sequences (80%)
- Validation: 6,100 sequences (20%)

Expected Training Time (GPU):
- ~30-60 minutes for 30K sequences
- 50 epochs with early stopping
```

### 7. Cost-Benefit Analysis

#### Option A: yfinance Only

```
Cost: FREE
Data: 5 quarters per stock
Training: IMPOSSIBLE (need 20 quarters minimum)
Valuation Quality: N/A (cannot train model)
```

#### Option B: Alpha Vantage FREE

```
Cost: FREE
Data: 81 quarters per stock (20 years!)
Training: 30,500 sequences from 500 stocks
Collection Time: 60 days (8 stocks/day)
Valuation Quality: HIGH (article shows +36% Sharpe)
Effort: Medium (automated batch processing)
```

#### Option C: Premium API ($14/month)

```
Cost: $14/month

### 8. Data Quality Advantages of Alpha Vantage

#### 1. **Historical Depth = Better Pattern Learning**

```
20 years covers:
- Multiple economic cycles
- 2008 Financial Crisis
- 2020 COVID-19 pandemic
- Tech boom & bust
- Growth ‚Üí Maturity transitions

Result: LSTM learns robust patterns, not just recent trends
```

#### 2. **Consistent Formatting**

```python
# Alpha Vantage always returns same structure:
{
    'fiscalDateEnding': '2025-06-30',
    'totalRevenue': '94040000000',
    'operatingIncome': '28200000000',
    ...
}

# vs. yfinance inconsistencies:
# - Different column names across versions
# - Missing values more common
# - Less standardized
```

#### 3. **Quarterly Precision**

```
81 quarters vs. 5 quarters:
- More granular growth patterns
- Seasonal effects captured
- Better short-term forecasting
```

#### 4. **No Survivorship Bias**

```
Alpha Vantage includes:
- Delisted companies (historical data preserved)
- Acquired companies
- Bankrupt companies

Training on survivors only ‚Üí Overly optimistic model
Training on all ‚Üí Realistic risk assessment
```

### 9. Practical Workflow

#### Week 1-2: Setup & Initial Collection

```bash
# Start batch collection
python scripts/fetch_lstm_training_data.py --start-index 0 --end-index 80
# Fetches 10 stocks/day = 80 stocks in 8 days
```

#### Week 3-8: Background Collection

```bash
# Continue daily while building other features
python scripts/fetch_lstm_training_data.py --start-index 80 --end-index 160
# 10 stocks/day √ó 42 days = 420 stocks
```

#### Week 9: Final Collection + Training

```bash
# Finish remaining stocks
python scripts/fetch_lstm_training_data.py --start-index 420 --end-index 500

# Train model
python scripts/train_lstm_growth_forecaster.py --epochs 50
# ~1 hour training on GPU
```

#### Week 10: Integration & Testing

```bash
# Integrate into analyze_stock.py
python scripts/analyze_stock.py AAPL --lstm-dcf
# See LSTM-forecasted growth rates in action!
```
