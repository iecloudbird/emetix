## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Quick Start

```python
from src.agents.enhanced_valuation_agent import EnhancedValuationAgent

# Initialize agent
agent = EnhancedValuationAgent()

# Natural language queries
result = agent.analyze("What is the consensus valuation for AAPL?")
print(result)
```

### Example Queries

**1. Traditional Analysis:**

```
"Give me a comprehensive valuation for Microsoft"
```

**2. LSTM-DCF Analysis:**

```
"Use LSTM-DCF hybrid valuation to analyze TSLA stock"
```

**3. RF Multi-Metric:**

```
"Perform Random Forest analysis on GOOGL to check if it's undervalued"
```

**4. Consensus (All Models):**

```
"What is the consensus valuation for NVDA using all available models?"
```

**5. Comparison:**

```
"Compare AAPL, MSFT, and GOOGL using all valuation methods"
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Inference Times

- **Traditional Valuation**: ~100ms
- **LSTM-DCF**: ~50ms (with cached data)
- **RF Ensemble**: ~61ms
- **Consensus**: ~200ms (all models combined)
- **Total**: < 300ms per stock

### Model Accuracy

- **LSTM-DCF**: Validation loss 0.000092 (excellent)
- **RF Ensemble**: R² varies by market conditions
- **Consensus**: Confidence > 75% indicates high agreement
